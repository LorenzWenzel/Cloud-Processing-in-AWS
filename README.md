# Cloud Processing – Reference Implementation (Enterprise‑Neutral)
## Purpose
This repository presents a generic reference implementation for a cloud‑native proteomics data‑processing platform.All organisation‑specific names, internal codes, and proprietary visuals have been removed or replaced by neutral placeholders so the solution can be shared publicly.

## Background
Modern proteomics experiments generate terabytes of raw mass‑spectrometry (MS) data every week. Turning these data into biological insight requires heavy compute, sophisticated statistical pipelines, and robust data‑management workflows. Local workstation resources quickly become a bottleneck, both for storage and for reproducible, scaled analytics.

## Architecture Description 
The project was implemented on AWS. Raw mass-spectrometry files are uploaded from the lab through an AWS Storage Gateway (File Gateway) into an encrypted, 
versioned S3. EventBridge routes Informations to a Lambda function; Lambda records metadata and launches the workflow via Nextflow Tower. 
Nextflow submits container jobs to AWS Batch, which spins up Spot- and On-Demand EC2 instances that are executing an analysis images pulled from Amazon ECR. 
Results land in a separate S3 results bucket, where analysts access them interactively through SageMaker Studio. End-to-end observability is provided by CloudWatch dashboards and logs, 
alerts flow through EventBridge, while IAM, VPC endpoints, and KMS encryption enforce security and compliance. 
Cost tracking and guard-rails are handled with AWS Budgets and detailed resource tagging.

## Execution
The whole Project is implemented with IAC Terraform language and a framework that allows to deploy docker images and fill assets such as lambda. 

## Business Value
Fully automated, end‑to‑end workflow reduces manual handling and allows new teams to join the project with less effort 

The overall analysis time for protein analysis could be reduced by more than 90%.
